# General Context and Guidelines:

## Scripts

Use these scripts to check for typescript and lint issues:

- `npm run ts-check` - Check for typescript errors
- `npm run lint` - Check for lint issues
- `npm run signal` - Check for ts, lint and prettier errors

You can also use the tools directly via `npx`:

- `npx tsc --noEmit [file]`
- `npx eslint [file]`

**Do NOT use `cd [path] && [command]` at the start of your commands** unless it is absolutely necessary. `cd` commands are blocked by default and require explicit permission, which slows us both down.
