# Continuity Camera Help Modal Implementation Plan

_Created: January 20, 2025_

## Overview

Add a help modal to assist users in connecting their iPhone as a continuity camera to the webcam monitor app.

## Feature Requirements

### UI Components Needed

1. **Special dropdown item** - At bottom of camera selection dropdown

   - Text: "Looking for your iPhone continuity camera?"
   - Different styling to distinguish from regular camera options
   - Triggers modal when clicked

2. **Help Modal** - Contains structured instructions
   - Clear, step-by-step guidance
   - Organized sections for different troubleshooting approaches
   - Professional but friendly tone
   - Easy to read formatting

### Content Structure

1. **Primary Steps** (most important/common)

   - Enable continuity camera in iPhone settings
   - Ensure no focus mode (especially sleep mode)
   - Ensure not in low power mode
   - Ensure no audio/video playing on iPhone
   - Open FaceTime app and check video dropdown

2. **USB-C Cable Method** (most reliable)

   - Plug iPhone into Mac with USB-C cable
   - Close and reopen FaceTime
   - Select iPhone from dropdown

3. **Wireless "Magic Pose" Method** (advanced/optional)
   - Phone in landscape orientation
   - Locked and motionless
   - Screen off
   - Back cameras facing user
   - Propped against laptop screen
   - Person needs to be in camera frame
   - May take 5-30 seconds to appear

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Modal Component

- [ ] Create `ContinuityCameraHelpModal.tsx` component
- [ ] Structure content into logical sections
- [ ] Add proper styling with MUI Joy
- [ ] Make it responsive and accessible

### Phase 2: Modify Controls Component

- [ ] Add special dropdown item to device list
- [ ] Style the special item differently (color, icon, etc.)
- [ ] Handle click event to open modal
- [ ] Ensure it appears at bottom of dropdown

### Phase 3: State Management

- [ ] Add modal open/close state to App.tsx
- [ ] Pass modal control props to Controls component
- [ ] Handle modal visibility properly

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish

- [ ] Test dropdown behavior
- [ ] Test modal open/close
- [ ] Verify responsive design
- [ ] Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Run `npm run signal` to check for issues
- [ ] Commit changes

## Technical Considerations

### Dropdown Modification

- The special item should be visually distinct but not disruptive
- Consider using a different icon (question mark, info, etc.)
- Should not interfere with regular camera selection

### Modal Design

- Use MUI Joy's Modal component for consistency
- Organize content with clear headings and sections
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Consider using icons for different steps
- Make sure it's not overwhelming to read

### Content Organization

1. **Quick Checklist** (most common issues)
2. **FaceTime Method** (primary approach)
3. **USB-C Method** (reliable backup)
4. **Magic Pose Method** (advanced, in smaller text/note section)
